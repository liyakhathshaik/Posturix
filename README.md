I am  developing an AI-powered yoga application designed to help users improve their posture and alignment during practice. The app uses real-time pose detection and correction powered by computer vision and machine learning, making yoga more accessible, safe, and effective — especially for beginners.

Currently, the app supports 10 essential beginner-friendly yoga poses, offering instant feedback on form, alignment, and duration held in the correct posture. Each pose is monitored using AI-driven joint angle analysis to ensure accuracy and provide gentle corrections where needed.

In addition to live feedback, the application also includes a pose guide and documentation to help users understand the purpose and benefits of each pose, along with how the correction system works.

This is just the beginning — the platform is designed to expand with more poses, progress tracking, and guided routines in the future.
